                also
                hope to help improve the world they live in by serving and investing in the communities we’re a part

                We founded Riot with the belief that a company of gamers, deeply committed to serving players, could
                deliver
                amazing game experiences. We believe that anyone with passion, vision, and perseverance can make a
                positive
                impact. As part of that ethos, we also believe that there are ways where we, as a company, can provide
                long-term value and positive impact to players, partners, Rioters, and the communities we serve.

                Through corporate social responsibility, we hope to help build a more positive world for the players and
                our
                communities. To do this, we focus on creating equal access to education and skills development and the
                promotion of positive citizenship in our communities.
